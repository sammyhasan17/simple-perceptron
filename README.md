Requirements:

You must have a biased neuron in the input layer. Remember that we have 16 samples available. You may divide them into some for training and some for testing.
Implement the perceptron to recognize 4 blocks image (such as one image shown below) to make a decision if an image is BRIGHT or DARK. Remember that we have 16 samples for the input.
– If it contains 2, 3 or 4 white pixels, it is “bright”
– If it contains 0 or 1 white pixels, it is “dark”
